## Project Evolution and Migration History

VapeMall represents a significant architectural evolution from a traditional monolithic application to a modern microservices-based platform. This migration demonstrates practical application of cloud-native principles and showcases the benefits of distributed system architecture.

### Original Monolithic Architecture

The project began as a monolithic e-commerce system hosted at [https://github.com/wh01sJake/mall-management-system](https://github.com/wh01sJake/mall-management-system). The original architecture consisted of:

**Monolithic Backend Services:**
- **mall-admin**: Administrative backend service (Port 8080)
- **mall-portal**: Customer-facing portal service (Port 8081)
- **mall-common**: Shared utilities and components
- **mall-pojo**: Data transfer objects and entities

**Frontend Applications:**
- **mall-admin-ui**: Vue.js administrative dashboard
- **mall-portal-ui**: Customer web interface

**Technology Stack (Legacy):**
- Spring Boot 2.x framework
- MySQL 8.0 database with MyBatis-Plus ORM
- Redis caching layer
- RabbitMQ message queuing
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Vue.js 3 with Vuex state management

### Migration Rationale

The decision to migrate from monolithic to microservices architecture was driven by several factors:

**Scalability Limitations:** The monolithic architecture created bottlenecks where the entire application needed to be scaled even when only specific components experienced high load.

**Development Complexity:** As the codebase grew, development teams faced challenges with code conflicts, deployment coordination, and technology stack limitations across different functional areas.

**Operational Challenges:** Single points of failure in the monolithic design meant that issues in one component could affect the entire system availability.

**Cloud-Native Requirements:** Modern cloud deployment strategies favor distributed architectures that can leverage container orchestration, auto-scaling, and fault tolerance patterns.

### Migration Process

The migration followed a systematic approach to decompose the monolithic application:

**1. Domain Decomposition:** Business capabilities were analyzed and separated into distinct bounded contexts:
- User management and authentication
- Product catalog and inventory
- Order processing and fulfillment
- Administrative operations
- Email notifications
- Analytics and reporting

**2. Service Extraction:** Each domain was extracted into independent microservices with dedicated databases and APIs:
- Gateway Service (API routing and authentication)
- Customer Service (user management)
- Product Service (catalog management)
- Order Service (order processing)
- Admin Service (administrative operations)
- Email Service (notifications)
- Statistics Service (analytics)

**3. Data Migration:** Database schemas were restructured to support the database-per-service pattern while maintaining data consistency through well-defined service contracts.

**4. Infrastructure Modernization:** Deployment infrastructure was updated to support distributed services with independent scaling, monitoring, and deployment capabilities.

### Architectural Improvements

The microservices migration delivered significant architectural improvements:

**Enhanced Scalability:** Individual services can now scale independently based on demand patterns, optimizing resource utilization and cost efficiency.

**Improved Fault Tolerance:** Service isolation prevents cascade failures, while circuit breaker patterns provide graceful degradation during service outages.

**Technology Diversity:** Each service can adopt optimal technology stacks for specific requirements, enabling innovation and performance optimization.

**Development Velocity:** Independent service development and deployment cycles enable faster feature delivery and reduced coordination overhead.

**Cloud-Native Capabilities:** The new architecture fully leverages cloud platform services including auto-scaling, load balancing, and managed databases.

### Legacy System Preservation

The original monolithic repository remains available for reference and educational purposes, demonstrating the evolution path from traditional to modern architectures. This preservation provides valuable insights into:
- Architectural decision-making processes
- Migration planning and execution strategies

## Design and Architecture

VapeMall employs a microservices architecture pattern that decomposes the application into seven independent services, each responsible for specific business capabilities. This design promotes scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance while enabling independent development and deployment cycles.

**Architectural Evolution:** The current microservices architecture represents a significant evolution from the original monolithic design (available at [https://github.com/wh01sJake/mall-management-system](https://github.com/wh01sJake/mall-management-system)). The migration from a two-service monolithic architecture (mall-admin and mall-portal) to seven specialized microservices demonstrates practical application of domain-driven design principles and modern cloud-native patterns.

**System Architecture Overview:**

The architecture follows a distributed pattern with an API Gateway serving as the single entry point for all client requests. The gateway handles cross-cutting concerns including authentication, routing, load balancing, and rate limiting. Behind the gateway, seven microservices operate independently, each with its own database schema and business logic.

*Figure 1: VapeMall System Architecture Diagram*

**Service Breakdown:**

| Service | Port | Heroku URL | Responsibility |
|---------|------|------------|----------------|
| Gateway | 9000 | [gateway-service-url].herokuapp.com | API routing, authentication |
| Admin | 8081 | [admin-service-url].herokuapp.com | Administrative operations |
| Product | 8082 | [product-service-url].herokuapp.com | Product catalog management |
| Customer | 8083 | [customer-service-url].herokuapp.com | User management |
| Order | 8084 | [order-service-url].herokuapp.com | Order processing |
| Email | 8085 | [email-service-url].herokuapp.com | Email notifications |
| Statistics | 8086 | [statistics-service-url].herokuapp.com | Analytics and reporting |

**Communication Patterns:**

Services communicate through synchronous HTTP REST APIs using OpenFeign clients for type-safe service-to-service communication. The system implements the Circuit Breaker pattern to handle service failures gracefully and prevent cascade failures.

```
*Figure 2: Microservices Communication Flow*

**Data Architecture:**

Each microservice maintains its own data store following the Database-per-Service pattern. This ensures loose coupling and allows services to choose optimal data storage technologies. All services currently use MySQL with shared connection to a DigitalOcean managed database cluster.

**Security Architecture:**

The system implements JWT-based authentication with the following flow:
1. Users authenticate through Customer or Admin services
2. Services generate signed JWT tokens containing user claims
3. API Gateway validates tokens for protected endpoints
4. Services receive validated user context for authorization decisions

**Deployment Architecture:**

The system is deployed on Heroku platform-as-a-service with the following characteristics:
- Each microservice runs in independent dynos
- Automatic scaling based on traffic patterns
- Health monitoring and automatic restart capabilities
- Environment-specific configuration management
- SSL termination and custom domain support

**Frontend Architecture:**

Two separate Vue.js applications provide user interfaces:
- Customer UI: Public-facing shopping interface
- Admin UI: Administrative management console

Both applications are deployed on Vercel with global CDN distribution and communicate with backend services through the API Gateway.
